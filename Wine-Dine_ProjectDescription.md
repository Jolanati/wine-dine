# Wine Peer

Deep Learning Project - RSU

*Photograph your food. Discover your perfect wine.*

---

## 1. Project Idea

Wine Peer is a deep learning application that bridges the gap between what a person is eating and what they should be drinking. The core concept is simple: a user photographs their meal, and the app returns three wine recommendations — one that matches the food’s characteristic flavors, one that goes in the opposite direction to cut through and refresh, and one that offers an unexpected complementary angle — each with a real tasting note from a Vivino user and an approval percentage.

The motivation comes from a genuine everyday moment. You sit down at a restaurant, or you are cooking at home, and you wonder what to drink. Wine pairing guides exist but are rarely accessible at the moment of decision. Wine Peer makes that knowledge available through a single photograph.

The project is academically grounded in two independent machine learning tasks — image classification and text classification — connected by a flavor embedding layer. A CNN recognises the food, Word2Vec maps food flavor vocabulary to grape variety vocabulary, and a BiLSTM retrieves genuine tasting language from 824,000 real Vivino reviews. This architecture satisfies the dual-dataset and CNN+LSTM requirement of the project rubric while producing a product concept with genuine real-world utility.

## 2. Product

### 2.1 User Flow

The interaction is designed to take under 10 seconds from input to output:

1. User opens Wine Peer and photographs their meal on a plate or table.
2. The CNN model identifies the dish from the image.
3. The food's flavor profile (a set of taste-descriptor keywords in wine vocabulary) is looked up from the food flavor table.
4. Word2Vec — trained on 824,000 real Vivino reviews — maps those keywords into the same flavor embedding space as grape varieties. Cosine similarity finds the best match for each of three pairing intents: Characteristic, Opposite, Unexpected.
5. The BiLSTM encoder scores a random sample of 2,000 test-set reviews and picks the one whose confidence for the target grape sits at the **median** of the distribution — a representative tasting note, not an outlier inflated by winner-takes-all scoring.
6. The user sees the dish name, three wine recommendations (one per intent) with grape variety, a real wine bottle name, a genuine drinker quote, and a Vivino approval percentage.

## 3. Datasets

### 3.1 Image Dataset — Food-101

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Name** | Food-101 |
| **Source** | ETH Zurich / torchvision |
| **Load command** | `torchvision.datasets.Food101(root=DATA_DIR, download=True)` |
| **Size** | 101,000 images across 101 food categories |
| **Classes** | 101 dishes: pizza, sushi, steak, burger, ramen, curry, salad, pasta and more |
| **Split** | 750 training images and 250 test images per class |
| **Format** | RGB images, variable resolution, pre-labeled by class folder |

Food-101 is one of the most widely used food image classification benchmarks in computer vision research. Its class labels map directly and naturally to flavor profiles, enabling a clean handoff to the pairing logic layer.

### 3.2 Text Dataset — WineSensed (Vivino Reviews)

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Name** | WineSensed — Learning to Taste (NeurIPS 2023) |
| **Source** | Hugging Face Hub |
| **Load command** | `load_dataset("Dakhoo/L2T-NeurIPS-2023", "vintages", trust_remote_code=True)` |
| **Size** | 824,000 real Vivino user tasting notes tied to 350,000+ unique wine vintages |
| **Key columns** | `review` (tasting note), `wine` (name), `year` (vintage), `grape` (variety), `rating` (Vivino avg 0–5), `country`, `region` |
| **License** | CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 — non-commercial research use |

WineSensed is a NeurIPS 2023 multimodal wine dataset built from Vivino data. Every review is a genuine human-written tasting note. The primary grape variety (first entry in the `grape` column) serves as the BiLSTM classification label. The top 15 grape varieties by review count are used as the 15 classification classes, covering approximately 85% of all reviews.

## 4. High-Level Architecture

The project pipeline consists of four sequential layers. Each layer is independently trained and evaluated before being connected into the full pipeline.

```text
PHOTO → CNN → food label → food flavor profile (JSON) → Word2Vec cosine similarity → grape variety (Characteristic / Opposite / Unexpected) → BiLSTM review retrieval (median confidence, test set) → flavor language + rating %
```

| Step | Component | Function | Dataset |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | CNN — Image Classifier | Takes a food photograph as input. Outputs a food category label from 101 classes. | Food-101 |
| 2 | Food Flavor Table | Each of the 101 food classes has three sets of taste-descriptor keywords (plain language, not wine vocabulary): `characteristic`, `opposite`, `unexpected`. Stored in `data/food_flavor_table.json`. | External curated file |
| 3 | Word2Vec — Flavor Embedding | Pre-trained on Google News (300-d), fine-tuned on WineSensed review text. Maps food flavor keywords and grape variety review language into the same 300-d vector space. Cosine similarity returns the closest grape centroid (15 × 300) per pairing intent. | WineSensed |
| 4 | BiLSTM — Review Retrieval | Trained on WineSensed reviews for 15-class grape classification. At inference, the encoder scores 2,000 randomly sampled test-set reviews; the review at the **median BiLSTM confidence** (50th percentile) is shown as a representative tasting note. The median avoids the winner-takes-all inflation of argmax and the overconfidence of uncalibrated softmax scores. The wine with the highest Vivino rating for that grape is selected from `df_wine`. | WineSensed |
| 5 | DistilBERT (Bonus) | Fine-tuned `distilbert-base-uncased` on the same 15-class grape classification task. Compared against LSTM and BiLSTM in Section 11.12 as a Transformer-based encoder alternative. | WineSensed |
| 6 | Output Layer | Combines CNN label + Word2Vec pairings + BiLSTM-retrieved Vivino quote + wine name + rating percentage into a structured recommendation card. | Combined |

### 4.1 CNN Architecture

The CNN uses a transfer learning approach based on ResNet-50, with the classification head fine-tuned on Food-101. Transfer learning is chosen because the base model carries strong general visual features from ImageNet training, significantly reducing the training time and data required to reach competitive accuracy on food classification.

- Input: RGB food image, resized to 224×224
- Backbone: ResNet-50 pre-trained on ImageNet (frozen in early epochs)
- Classification head: Linear layer with 101 output units, softmax activation
- Output: Food category label with confidence score

#### 4.1.1 CNN from Scratch — Two Generations

Alongside the ResNet-50 transfer learning model, we implemented a CNN trained entirely from scratch on Food-101. This model went through two distinct design generations.

**Generation 1 — First attempt (3 single-conv blocks)**

The initial scratch architecture was modest by design: three convolutional blocks, each consisting of a single convolution followed by batch normalisation, ReLU activation, and max pooling. After the third block the spatial maps were globally averaged to a 256-dimensional feature vector, which was then passed through a single-layer classifier head (256 → 512 → 101).

Training this model triggered the early stopping mechanism twice before it reached epoch 13, peaking at around 27% validation accuracy. With only 101 classes to separate and relatively little representational capacity, the network was essentially underpowered for the task.

**Generation 2 — Redesigned architecture (4 double-conv VGG-style blocks)**

After analysing the training failure, we redesigned the scratch CNN around five targeted improvements. Each change addresses a specific weakness:

**1. Double convolutions per block — looking twice before moving on**

Originally the model would process a spatial scale once and immediately zoom out. The new design runs two convolutions at the same scale before pooling, following the pattern proven by VGGNet. Think of identifying a pizza: one look might catch "it's round and flat," but a second look at the same zoom level also catches "it has crust edges and uneven toppings." More detail is extracted before moving to the next level of abstraction.

**2. A fourth block (256 → 512 channels) — one extra level of abstraction**

The original model had three zoom levels going from fine details to bigger patterns. Adding a fourth gives it one more step to reason about higher-level concepts — not just "these are grill marks" but "grill marks on meat typically mean this is a burger or steak." With 101 classes to distinguish, the extra representational depth makes a meaningful difference.

**3. A wider, deeper classifier head — more thinking space at the end**

After all the visual analysis, the model must make its final decision. The original architecture used a single 512-neuron layer for this. The new design uses a two-stage head: 512 → 1024 → 512 → 101. The wider first room allows more deliberation across candidate categories before narrowing to a final vote.

**4. Dropout2d after each pool — preventing the model from getting lazy**

`Dropout2d(0.1)` is added after every max-pooling layer. During training this randomly zeroes entire feature channels, forcing the network not to over-rely on any single visual cue — like a teacher who covers random parts of your notes before a test, pushing you to understand the material rather than memorise specific spots.

**5. RandomErasing augmentation — showing messier photos on purpose**

`RandomErasing(p=0.2)` is added as the final training augmentation step. With 20% probability it blacks out a random rectangle in the image, simulating partial occlusion — a plate half in frame, a hand in the shot, a shadow. Combined with existing augmentations (random crop, flip, rotation, colour jitter), the model never sees the same photo twice in exactly the same way, which teaches it to recognise food regardless of lighting, angle, or partial obstruction.

**Comparison summary**

| | Generation 1 | Generation 2 |
|---|---|---|
| Convolutions per block | 1 | 2 (VGG-style) |
| Convolutional blocks | 3 | 4 |
| Deepest feature map | 256 ch | 512 ch |
| Feature vector | 256-d | 512-d |
| Spatial dropout | — | `Dropout2d(0.1)` after each pool |
| Classifier head | 256 → 512 → 101 | 512 → 1024 → 512 → 101 |
| RandomErasing augmentation | No | `p=0.2` |

### 4.2 LSTM Architecture

The BiLSTM is trained on WineSensed review text to classify text into 15 grape variety categories. The model learns to associate descriptive language — *"cassis and cedar"* for Cabernet Sauvignon, *"strawberry and forest floor"* for Pinot Noir, *"mineral and citrus"* for Riesling — with grape labels. At inference time, the trained encoder retrieves the most representative real Vivino review per recommended grape: the review whose hidden-state vector sits closest to the grape centroid. No text is generated; all quotes shown to the user are genuine Vivino language.

- Input: Tokenised Vivino review text, padded to fixed length
- Embedding: GloVe-100d pre-trained word vectors
- Recurrent layer: Bidirectional LSTM (128 units, output 256-d)
- Classification output: 15 grape variety classes (training task)
- Inference mode: Grape-conditioned representative review retrieval

A unidirectional LSTM is also trained as a baseline for comparison.

### 4.3 Word2Vec Pairing

We start from Google's pre-trained Word2Vec (trained on ~100 billion words of Google News). This means the model already understands everyday food language — *tomato*, *spicy*, *fatty*, *smoky* all have well-placed vectors before any wine-specific training begins.

We then fine-tune this model on all 824k WineSensed Vivino reviews. Fine-tuning adds wine-specific vocabulary (*Sangiovese*, *tannic*, *cassis*, *terroir*) and repositions existing words so their neighborhoods reflect how wine reviewers use them. The result is a single vector space where food words and wine tasting words sit on the same map.

Grape embeddings are computed by averaging all word vectors across reviews for each of the 15 grape varieties. At inference, food flavor keywords are embedded and matched to grape vectors by cosine similarity.

| Pairing intent | Mechanism | What gets returned |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Safe Bet** | W2V rank-1 cosine similarity to classic flavor keywords | Grape whose tasting vocabulary best matches the food's flavor profile |
| **Bold Move** | Grape centroid most geometrically distant from Safe Bet | Stylistically opposite grape — the sommelier surprise |
| **Hidden Gem** | Top-5 flavor matches; pick most distant from Safe Bet centroid | Real flavor affinity with the food, but not the obvious first pick |

#### 4.3.1 Vocabulary Mismatch — A Real Implementation Challenge

During implementation we discovered a critical vocabulary gap. The food flavor table is written in natural food language: *cheesy*, *baked*, *greasy*, *starchy*, *fatty*. These words exist in Google News Word2Vec but **drift to meaningless regions** after fine-tuning on wine text — wine reviewers never write those words. A filter (`_WINE_VOCAB`) that keeps only words appearing in both the model and the actual training corpus silently dropped most food keywords, leaving 1–2 words to represent each dish. The result: all three pairings returned the same grape regardless of the food.

This revealed a design tension:

> The food flavor table *should* stay in food language — that is what curators naturally write and understand. The pipeline should do the translation, not the data.

#### 4.3.2 Solution — Query Expansion as a Translation Layer

We implement a **query expansion** step inside the embedding function. For each food keyword, we find its top-N nearest Word2Vec neighbours **within the wine vocabulary** — words that genuinely appear in wine reviews. This translates food-world descriptors into wine-world equivalents automatically:

| Food keyword | Expands to (wine vocab neighbours) |
|---|---|
| `cheesy` | *buttery, creamy, rich, lactic, oaky, fat* |
| `baked` | *toasty, roasted, warm, caramelised, spiced* |
| `tomato` | *cherry, raspberry, redcurrant, plum, cassis* |
| `greasy` | *oily, heavy, full-bodied, rich, fat* |

The expanded set of 20–30 wine-world terms is IDF-weighted (rare grape-specific words upweighted) and embedded. The food flavor JSON remains in natural food language. The expansion layer is the explicit bridge between the two vocabularies — automatic, data-driven, and not hard-coded.

### 4.4 Food Flavor Table

The food flavor table is the bridge between the CNN's food label and the Word2Vec pairing system. It is a Python dictionary embedded directly in the notebook (no external file dependency). Each of the 101 Food-101 food classes has three sets of flavor keywords in grape-specific wine vocabulary:

```python
"pizza": {
    "complement": ["earthy", "savory", "cherry", "leather", "tannic", "herbaceous"],
    "contrast":   ["mineral", "crisp", "citrus", "steely", "dry", "acidic"],
    "balance":    ["light", "fruity", "clean", "gentle", "soft", "easy"],
}
```

Because we fine-tune from Google News Word2Vec, the flavor table can use natural food language — *tomato*, *fatty*, *smoky*, *creamy* — alongside wine tasting words. All of these have meaningful vectors in the fine-tuned model.

### 4.5 Why Grape Classification Rather Than Wine Types

Classifying by grape variety (Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Chardonnay…) rather than broad wine type (Red / White / Rosé) makes the text classification task significantly harder and more meaningful:

- The model must learn fine-grained flavor language — *"cassis and cedar"* vs *"strawberry and silk"* — not just colour-level signals.
- The output is more specific and useful: *"you'd like a Sangiovese"* rather than *"you'd like a Red wine"*.
- Word2Vec embeddings per grape place varieties in a nuanced flavor space where Syrah and Malbec cluster together but far from Riesling.

**The 15 grape classes** (selected by frequency, covering ~85% of all WineSensed reviews):

| Reds | Whites |
| --- | --- |
| Cabernet Sauvignon · Merlot · Pinot Noir · Syrah · Malbec · Sangiovese · Tempranillo · Grenache · Zinfandel | Chardonnay · Sauvignon Blanc · Riesling · Pinot Grigio · Viognier · Chenin Blanc |
